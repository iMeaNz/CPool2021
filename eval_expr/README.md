# EvalExpr
The goal of this project is to write the `eval_expr` function  
It takes a string as parameter, which represents a mathematical expression, evaluates this expression and returns the result as an integer.  
The string received as parameter will always be valid (no syntax errors, no divisions by zero,. . . ).  
The following five operators must be supported:  
• ‘+’ for addition  
• ‘-’ for subtraction  
• ‘/’ for division  
• ’*’ for multiplication  
• ‘%’ for modulo.  
The function must also handle any number of parenthesis.
