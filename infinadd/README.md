# InfinAdd
The goal of this project is to write a program that performs an infinite addition.  
This program must take two strings (both of which represent numbers) as parameters and then write a string on the standard output that represents the result of the sum.  
The displayed string is the result of adding both of these strings together.  
The result must be displayed without spaces. No zeros can come before the result.
A negative number will be preceded by one, and only one, minus sign.  
The only system functions allowed are `write`, `malloc` and `free`
